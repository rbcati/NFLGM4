# Long-Save Durability Authority V2

Base SHA: `a4f47f47e46e38db834024248484852aeac63ddf`.

## Why V1 determinism was insufficient

The previous durability report could set `deterministic=true` when two runs had the same lifecycle completion metadata, first-failure shape, and save/reload booleans. It did not compare durable roster, contract, cap, player, pick, schedule, or history state at corresponding checkpoints. V2 adds a canonical durable-state snapshot and compares checkpoint state directly.

## Snapshot fields and normalization

Snapshot schema `2.0.0` includes league phase/year/week/season id/user team/live salary cap; authoritative DB-backed teams with records, roster membership, dead cap, deferred dead cap, and stable cap fields; active players with canonical ids, team ids, age, ratings, injury availability, canonical normalized contract fields, and active cap hit; retired-player ledger rows; draft picks; schedule identity/results; completed history champion/runner-up references; and pool counts/source.

Normalization now resolves object-shaped legacy champion and runner-up team references with the canonical team-reference resolver, includes retired ledger evidence from view and DB meta, preserves duplicate entity occurrences during structured comparison, and reports diffs with canonical entity ids rather than array positions.

Excluded fields remain timestamps, narrative/UI-only text, raw serialization order not guaranteed by production, and volatile completion metadata.

## Stable cap equation

At stable cap checkpoints, each team is legal when:

`sum(active roster cap hits from canonical contracts) + current dead cap + counted pending commitments <= live salary cap`

The live cap is resolved from `view.economy.currentSalaryCap` or `db.meta.economy.currentSalaryCap`. Team dead cap and roster contracts come from authoritative DB team/player records when available. Staff payroll is excluded because production cap legality excludes it. Transitional offseason windows skip cap legality with a documented reason rather than pretending those reconciliation windows are final legal gates.

## Continuity rules

V2 continuity now checks that completed history grows exactly once at completed rollover checkpoints, schedule game ids are not reused across seasons, active/retired populations do not overlap, full-pool checkpoints do not lose established players without retirement/draft/release/free-agency/removal evidence, and contract years do not increase unless a signing/extension/restructure transaction occurred inside the compared checkpoint window (old retained transaction probes no longer excuse later corruption).

Roster-only checkpoints explicitly skip player-disappearance proof with a narrow reason because the full free-agent/retired pool is not present in those view-only snapshots.

## Isolation model

CLI determinism legs and `--seeds` runs execute in clean child processes. This avoids reusing worker module globals, caches, fake IndexedDB state, and seeded RNG state between legs/seeds. In-process harness helpers remain available for unit tests and bounded stubs.

## Production root causes repaired in this iteration

- Retired players were evicted from the hot cache after offseason retirement without durable `meta.retiredPlayers` evidence, so continuity could not distinguish retirement from disappearance after old players left the DB player pool. The repair persists a compact retired-player ledger before eviction.
- AI stable rollover could enter preseason with an AI roster below the legal minimum after retirements/cuts/free agency. The repair adds a deterministic minimum-roster reconciliation pass that signs from the existing free-agent pool, respects interactive-user isolation, creates fresh production-shaped contracts instead of inheriting released-player contracts/restructure metadata, validates projected cap legality before commit, and recalculates all team caps before the preseason save surface.
- Save/reload could observe stale pre-save cap aggregates because not every final rollover roster mutation recalculated team cap fields before flushing. The repair recalculates every team cap after final rollover roster reconciliation.
- Several ordering boundaries that affect offers/releases/RNG draw order lacked canonical tie-breaks: AI FA target inputs, equal-score FA offer resolution, offseason roster-cut candidate ties, offseason extension/progression team/player iteration, staff-carousel team/market ties, free-agent offer arrays, and FA offer timestamps. These were narrowed to canonical id/name tie-breaks or deterministic phase/week stamps without changing balance formulas.
- Retention market heat used a falsy team-id predicate, so rostered team `0` players could be counted as free agents. The repair uses `teamId == null` plus non-retired/non-draft status filtering for the market free-agent pool.
- Minimum-roster reconciliation now uses the canonical signable-free-agent predicate, live economy cap before stale team cap totals, pre-commit cap projection, and post-mutation rollback without emitting a SIGN transaction on failure.
- Durable schedule normalization now uses production season identity precedence (`seasonId ?? season ?? year ?? null`) so schedule reuse across different production season IDs is detectable.

## Current evidence

Commands run on this branch after the minimum-roster contract, bounded continuity evidence, team-id-0 retention, and FA ordering/timestamp repairs:

- `node --check src/core/ai-logic.js && node --check src/core/retention/reSigning.js && node --check tests/durability/invariants/continuity.js` — passed.
- `node --check src/worker/worker.js` — passed.
- `npx vitest run tests/unit/aiCapManagementExecution.test.js --config vitest.config.ts` — passed, 1 file / 16 tests.
- `npx vitest run src/core/__tests__/retention-board.test.js --config vitest.config.ts` — passed, 1 file / 4 tests.
- `npm run durability:test` — passed, 5 files / 83 tests.
- `npm run check:sim-types` — passed.
- `npm run build` — passed with the existing Vite chunk-size warning.
- `npm run durability:smoke` — passed one full season with save/reload OK (201 pass / 0 fail / 39 skip, peak RSS 455 MB).
- `npm run test:unit` — passed, 462 files / 5663 tests.
- `npm run durability:5 -- --seed=1684 --determinism --collect-all --write-report --summary` — completed both isolated five-season legs with zero invariant failures and save/reload OK in both legs, but exited nonzero because state determinism remained false.

Latest five-season determinism result:

- Seed: 1684
- Completed: 5/5 seasons in each isolated child leg
- First leg runtime/peak RSS: 508.5 seconds / 2212 MB
- Second leg runtime/peak RSS: 516.5 seconds / 2174 MB
- Invariants: 750 pass / 0 fail / 132 skip in both legs
- Save/reload: OK at season 1 and season 5 in both legs
- Lifecycle deterministic: true
- State deterministic: false
- First remaining durable divergence: checkpoint `2:afterSeasonRollover`, domain `players`, entity `5013`, field `teamId`

The current first reported divergence is now player `5013.teamId` (`27` vs `28`) at `2:afterSeasonRollover`. This confirms there is still at least one unrepaired FA/offseason ordering boundary upstream of durable team assignment and contract differences, so the PR must remain red for Durability Authority V2.

## Remaining limitations / not yet proven

This branch must still not claim five-season state determinism, ten-season safety, or multi-seed durable authority. The season-5 roster-size failure is gone and save/reload is stable in the latest five-season runs, but the seed-1684 five-season state-determinism gate is still red. Because that principal determinism gate remains red, the three-seed five-season matrix, ten-season seed-1684 proof, and optional twenty-season run were not honestly claimable from this head.

## Focused reconciliation and retired-jersey follow-up

Minimum-roster reconciliation now recalculates the existing positional-need authority after every successful signing. This preserves the existing valuation, cap projection, rollback, and deterministic candidate tie-breaks while preventing a roster that is short at several positions from repeatedly using the priority order computed before its first signing.

Compact retirement ledger rows now persist `jerseyNumber` for new retirements. The retired-jersey resolver remains backward-compatible: when an old compact row has no valid number, it loads the full persisted player row instead of treating the incomplete ledger row as authoritative. It does not restore that full player to the hot cache.

Focused verification on the checked-out head passed (`41` targeted tests), as did the complete unit suite (`462` files / `5667` tests), simulation type check, build, durability unit tier, one-season durability smoke, and local `check:deploy` production/deploy-preview parity builds. Because positional recalculation changes deterministic reconciliation output, the five-season isolated determinism gate was rerun. Both legs completed with zero invariant failures and save/reload OK, but this checkout reported `lifecycleDeterministic=true`, `stateDeterministic=false`, with the first difference at `4:afterSeasonRollover`, player `1046.activeCapHit`. Therefore this evidence does not claim that state determinism is green on the checked-out head.
