# Long-Save Durability Harness (V1)

## 1. Purpose

Prove **exactly where multi-season saves fail**. This is a deterministic,
automated franchise-simulation harness that drives the **real production
lifecycle** over many seasons and answers, repeatably:

- how many seasons complete;
- where the first failure occurs (season, phase, week, entity);
- which invariant fails;
- whether the failure is deterministic;
- whether save/reload changes the result;
- which repair PR should come next.

It is **test infrastructure and evidence gathering**, not a gameplay-balance or
broad-repair change. It does **not** re-implement any simulation, schedule,
draft, progression, free-agency, or offseason rule — it invokes the production
worker and validates the state the game itself produces.

## 2. Architecture findings (pre-task investigation, verified against `main`)

| Question | Finding |
|---|---|
| Production league initializer | `buildDefaultLeague` (`src/data/defaultLeague.ts`), invoked through the worker's `USE_SAFE_STARTER_LEAGUE` handler (`src/worker/worker.js:2679`). Validated by `getPlayableLeagueValidation`. |
| New-franchise creation path | `USE_SAFE_STARTER_LEAGUE` is a **real production path** — it is the safe-boot fallback used by the UI (`src/ui/App.jsx` `handleSafeStarterLeague`, `src/ui/hooks/useWorker.js`). It seeds RNG via `Utils.setSeed(options.rngSeed)` and persists through the real DB layer. |
| Season lifecycle orchestrator | `SIM_TO_PHASE` (`handleSimToPhase`, `src/worker/worker.js:5172`) is the single batch orchestrator. It internally calls `handleAdvanceWeek` (regular/playoffs/preseason), `handleAdvanceOffseason` (resign), `handleAdvanceFreeAgencyDay`, `handleAdvanceCombineWeek`, `handleStartDraft`/`handleSimDraftPick` (draft), and rolls into the next season. **`ADVANCE_WEEK` is intentionally rejected during the offseason** — `SIM_TO_PHASE` is the only correct way to advance it. |
| One function advances a full season? | Yes — `SIM_TO_PHASE({ targetPhase: 'preseason' })` advances a complete season (regular → playoffs → offseason → draft → FA → rollover) up to its internal iteration cap (`MAX_ITERATIONS=800`, draft inner guard `500`). |
| User decisions required? | No — the batch path uses `skipUserGame:true` and AI automation for all decisions; deterministic defaults exist. |
| Cache / global state reset | The worker holds a module-level `cache`. `USE_SAFE_STARTER_LEAGUE` calls `clearAllData()` + `cache.reset()` + `cache.hydrate(...)`, so re-initializing fully resets in-memory + DB state between runs. |
| Headless worker-only path | Yes — `src/testSupport/dynastySoakRunner.js` exposes `loadWorkerModule()` + `dispatchWorker()`, a `postMessage` bridge that runs the real worker in Node with `fake-indexeddb`. **This is the same worker the browser uses**, not a shortcut engine. The harness reuses this bridge. |
| Existing multi-season utilities | Yes — the **dynasty soak** stack (`scripts/dynasty-soak.mjs`, `src/testSupport/dynastySoak*.js`, `src/core/dynastySoakAudit.js`). This harness is complementary: it adds a phase-aware, separately-importable invariant framework, checkpoint save/reload validation, and a stable machine-readable report. |
| Save serialization / reload | Real path: `SAVE_NOW` flushes the cache to IndexedDB via `src/db/index.js`; `LOAD_SAVE` rehydrates. The full pool (including free agents, which are **not** in the rostered-only `FULL_STATE` view) is read back through `Players.loadAll()` / `Teams.loadAll()` / `DraftPicks.byOwner()` / `Meta.load()`. |
| In-memory storage adapter | `fake-indexeddb` provides the Node-side IndexedDB; no browser required. |
| Regular vs playoff records | Regular-season W/L/T live on `team.wins/losses/ties`; playoff outcomes are separate (`championTeamId`, `playoffSeeds`). Game counts differ per team — playoffs are evaluated separately and never folded into per-team regular-season expectations. |
| History / awards archive | `meta.leagueHistory[]` (completed seasons), `meta.awardHistory` / `meta.franchiseAwards`, `meta.retiredPlayers`, `meta.recordBook`. Surfaced in the view + persisted. |
| Transitional phases | `offseason_resign`, `offseason`, `free_agency`, `draft_combine`, `draft` legitimately permit temporarily incomplete rosters, unsigned rookies, and cleared champions. |

### Key determinism finding

Game simulation, draft generation, injuries and progression are seeded through
`Utils.setSeed` (`src/core/utils.js`). **However, many production modules still
call unseeded `Math.random()`** — e.g. `aiTradeEngine`, `aiToAiTradeEngine`,
`aiFaEngine`, `aiRetentionLogic`, `playerMoraleEngine`, `coachingEngine`,
`eventSystem`, `waiverEngine`, `ownerPressureEngine`, `legacyEngine`,
`teamIdentityEngine`, `leaguePulse`, `staff-system`. Consequently **full
byte-for-byte determinism across runs is not currently guaranteed**. This is
recorded as a *non-deterministic behavior* finding (see §22). Per the task
scope, **no broad RNG rewrite is performed here.** The harness therefore
compares a *normalized canonical outcome* for its determinism check, not raw
state.

### Key performance finding

The **offseason (draft + free agency over 32 teams) dominates runtime**. A full
season's regular + playoffs completes in ~15s headless, but the
offseason→preseason rollover (224 AI draft selections with scouting evaluation +
FA waves) can take **several minutes**. This is why the existing dynasty-soak
"full" profile is manual-only, and it drives the CI tiering below (§17).

## 3. Production lifecycle path used

```
INIT
USE_SAFE_STARTER_LEAGUE { rngSeed, userTeamId:0 }   → afterInit checkpoint
loop season s = 1..N:
  SIM_TO_PHASE 'playoffs'    → afterRegularSeason checkpoint
  SIM_TO_PHASE 'offseason'   → afterPlayoffs checkpoint
  SIM_TO_PHASE 'preseason'   → afterSeasonRollover checkpoint (+ DB pool)
  [durability checkpoint] SAVE_NOW → LOAD_SAVE → afterReload checkpoint
```

The driver (`tests/durability/lifecycleDriver.js`) is **thin**: it only invokes
these production messages in order and gathers state. All season business rules
stay inside the worker.

## 4. Real league initializer used

`USE_SAFE_STARTER_LEAGUE` with `{ slotKey: 'save_slot_1', options: { rngSeed:
<seed>, userTeamId: 0, name: 'Durability <seed>' } }`. No synthetic teams,
rosters, schedules, or contracts are constructed. The seed is the only
deterministic input, and it is a first-class option of the production handler.

## 5. Seed & determinism behavior

- Default seed: **1684** (`DEFAULT_SEED`, overridable with `--seed=<n>`).
- The seed flows to `Utils.setSeed` inside the real initializer.
- Determinism is checked with `runDeterminismCheck` (two clean runs, normalized
  outcome comparison). Because of the unseeded `Math.random()` sources above,
  the normalized comparison — not raw state — is authoritative; excluded
  volatile fields are documented in §13.

## 6. Harness structure

```
tests/durability/
  lifecycleDriver.js        # thin production-lifecycle driver + DB pool reader
  longSaveHarness.js        # orchestrator: modes, checkpoints, fail-fast/collect-all, determinism
  report.js                 # stable machine-readable report + console formatter
  cli.js                    # pure arg parsing + report file I/O
  longSaveHarness.test.js   # pure invariant unit tests + bounded real-lifecycle smoke
  reports/                  # committed representative reports (stable filenames)
  invariants/
    helpers.js  bounds.js  derive.js  index.js   # framework + registry
    roster.js  cap.js  draft.js  freeAgency.js  schedule.js
    progression.js  retirement.js  history.js  references.js
    numericSafety.js  saveReload.js
scripts/long-save-durability.mjs   # node entrypoint (loads fake-indexeddb first)
vitest.durability.config.ts        # dedicated config for the focused test
```

Lifecycle driving, invariant evaluation, report formatting and the test entry
point are separated so follow-up PRs can add invariants without touching one
giant file.

## 7. Fail-fast mode (default)

Stops at the **first** invariant failure or lifecycle exception and reports the
exact season, phase, week and entity. Intended for CI and focused debugging.

## 8. Collect-all mode (`--collect-all`)

Continues as far as safely possible, accumulating every invariant failure,
grouped by checkpoint (season + phase) in `report.checkpoints[]`. A lifecycle
crash still stops the run, but all failures discovered beforehand are preserved.

## 9. Checkpoint definitions & mapping

| Harness checkpoint | Real league phase reached | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `afterInit` | `regular` (week 1) | full DB pool + probes |
| `afterRegularSeason` | `playoffs` | view-only |
| `afterPlayoffs` | `offseason_resign`/`offseason` | champion present; full DB pool |
| `afterSeasonRollover` | `preseason` (next year) | full DB pool + probes; save/reload baseline |
| `afterReload` | `preseason` (reloaded) | at durability checkpoints only |

The task's finer-grained checkpoints (after draft, after free agency, before/
after rollover) are **bundled** into the `SIM_TO_PHASE 'preseason'` transition
because the production offseason (draft → FA → rollover) advances as one
orchestrated batch that cannot be paused between those sub-phases without
driving internal worker handlers directly (out of scope for a thin driver).
`afterSeasonRollover` therefore represents the post-draft, post-FA, post-rollover
state, and this mapping is asserted honestly rather than faked.

## 10. Invariants

Each returns structured results `{ id, status, season, phase, week, entityType,
entityId, message, details }`. Categories & ids:

- **roster** — `size-within-legal-range`, `no-duplicate-membership`,
  `no-intra-team-duplicates`, `entries-have-valid-id`,
  `team-id-agrees-with-ownership`, `no-roster-and-free-agent-overlap`,
  `no-missing-player-reference`.
- **cap** — `aggregates-finite`, `contract-values-safe`,
  `contract-years-non-negative`.
- **schedule** — `standings-finite`, `games-reference-valid-teams`,
  `no-self-games`, `completed-games-have-result`, `champion-valid`.
- **progression** — `ovr-within-bounds`, `ratings-numeric-safe`,
  `active-age-reasonable`, `no-duplicate-ids`.
- **retirement** — `retired-not-active`, `ledger-valid-ids`,
  `no-impossibly-old-actives`.
- **draft** — `pick-single-owner`, `pick-references-valid-team`,
  `pick-round-season-valid`, `pick-population-bounded`,
  `no-duplicate-class-seasons`.
- **freeAgency** — `pool-size-bounded`, `no-duplicate-player-ids`,
  `no-multi-team-players`, `status-coherent`.
- **history** — `season-archive-exists`, `accumulates`,
  `champion-refs-valid`, `no-duplicate-seasons`, `award-refs-valid`.
- **references** — `player-to-team`, `depth-chart-to-roster`, `pick-to-team`,
  `offer-to-entities`.
- **numericSafety** — `durable-state-finite` (bounded recursive NaN/±Infinity
  scan with a schema-aware denylist).
- **saveReload** — `canonical-summary-stable`.

Bounds (roster 53/90, cap hard-cap 301.2, OVR 40–99, ages, draft 7×32, pool
envelope) are sourced from `src/core/constants.js` and documented with rationale
in `tests/durability/invariants/bounds.js`. They are **safety guards, not
balance rules.**

## 11. Phase-aware activation rules

Phase-aware invariants classify on the **actual league phase**
(`ctx.view.phase`), never on the harness checkpoint label.

- Roster **size** limits (53-man band) apply only in stable phases
  (`regular`/`playoffs`/`preseason`). During `offseason*`/`draft*`/`free_agency`
  the floor relaxes to "team owns ≥1 player, ≤ absolute ceiling".
- `history.season-archive-exists`/`accumulates` activate only at
  `afterSeasonRollover` for season ≥ 2 (season-1 archive semantics are skipped
  to avoid a transitional false positive).
- `schedule.champion-valid` activates in offseason/preseason; a champion cleared
  immediately after rollover is a **skip**, not a fail.
- `freeAgency.*`, `roster.no-roster-and-free-agent-overlap`, `references.player-
  to-team`, `progression.*` and `retirement.*` require the full DB pool; at
  view-only checkpoints they **skip with a reason**.

Every skip carries a documented reason; the registry demotes any reasonless skip
to a harness-bug failure.

## 12. Known false-positive risks

- **Offseason roster dips** — mitigated by phase-aware size floors.
- **Cleared champion after rollover** — treated as skip.
- **Unsigned rookies between draft and contract assignment** — the harness never
  asserts rookies must be signed at `afterSeasonRollover`.
- **Award omission** — optional awards the production system legitimately omits
  are not required; award checks only validate references when awards exist.
- **Pool-size envelope** — deliberately wide (`POOL.MAX_PLAYERS`) so normal
  churn never trips; only order-of-magnitude growth/collapse fails.
- **Draft-year pick population** — comp picks add slack (`MAX_PICKS_ENVELOPE`).

## 13. Save/reload strategy

At each durability checkpoint: capture a canonical pre-save summary → `SAVE_NOW`
→ `LOAD_SAVE` (real hydration) → re-read DB pool → re-run applicable invariants →
compare canonical summaries.

- **Compared for exact equality:** year, week, phase, teamCount,
  playerPoolSize, freeAgentCount, completedSeasonCount, championTeamId,
  userTeamId, and fingerprints for cap totals, roster membership, and draft-pick
  ownership.
- **Reconstructed / excluded (not compared):** derived view-only fields
  (`nextGameStakes`, `ownerApproval`, `fanApproval`, `mediaStories`,
  standings-tie ordering), narrative logs, and cache-only counters — these are
  rebuilt on hydration and are not part of the durable contract.

After reload the run **continues** into the next season, proving the save
remains playable, not merely parseable.

## 14. Report schema

Stable JSON (see `report.js`, `DurabilityReport`):

```jsonc
{
  "harnessVersion": "3.0.0", "gitSha": "…", "seed": 1684,
  "mode": "1-season", "failureMode": "fail-fast",
  "requestedSeasons": 1, "seasonsAttempted": 1, "seasonsCompleted": 0,
  "competitiveSeasonsCompleted": 1, "completedThrough": "afterPlayoffs", "boundedRun": true,
  "runtimeMs": 0, "peakMemoryMb": 0,
  "deterministic": null, "determinismDetail": null,
  "firstFailure": null,            // {season,phase,invariantId,entityType,entityId,message}
  "lifecycleException": null,
  "saveReload": [ { "season": 1, "phase": "afterReload", "ok": true, "mismatches": [] } ],
  "checkpoints": [ { "season", "phase", "week", "summary": {pass,fail,skip}, "results": [ … ] } ],
  "summary": { "passed": 0, "failed": 0, "skipped": 0 },
  "crashBlockersPatched": [], "deferredFindings": [],
  "recommendedNextRepairPR": null
}
```

`toSummaryJSON()` drops pass/skip result bodies (keeps failures + per-checkpoint
counts) for commit-safe long-run artifacts.

## 15. Commands

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `npm run durability:test` | **Required-tier** focused tests: all pure invariant unit tests + a **bounded real-lifecycle smoke** (real worker, init→regular→playoffs, ~18s). |
| `npm run durability:smoke` | 1-season full lifecycle incl. rollover + save/reload. |
| `npm run durability:5` | 5-season durability. |
| `npm run durability:10` | 10-season durability (manual). |
| `npm run durability:20` | 20-season durability (manual). |
| `npm run durability:report` | Regenerate committed 1- and 5-season reports. |
| `… -- --collect-all` | Collect-all failure mode. |
| `… -- --seed=1234` | Custom seed. |
| `… -- --determinism` | Two clean runs + determinism verdict. |
| `… -- --write-report --summary` | Write full + compact reports (stable names). |

### 15.1 Long-save memory and storage authority

Checkpoint reports deliberately separate three authorities:

- `metrics.memory` is **process heap/RAM** (`rss`, `heapUsed`, `heapTotal`,
  `external`, and `arrayBuffers`). With `--gc-at-boundaries`, season-boundary
  rows contain both `preGc` and `postGc` when the process exposes
  `global.gc`. Run with `node --expose-gc --import tsx
  scripts/long-save-durability.mjs ...`; if GC is unavailable the report says
  so and does not relabel pre-GC values as post-GC values.
- `metrics.persistentStorage` is a cursor-based census enabled by
  `--profile-storage`. Its byte values are deterministic UTF-8 JSON payload
  estimates. They are **not actual browser IndexedDB disk allocation** because
  browser encoding, indexes, implementation metadata, and page allocation are
  outside this measurement.
- `metrics.harnessRetention` accounts for diagnostic state. A report retains
  zero full canonical snapshots. The runner keeps only the immediately previous
  snapshot needed by continuity invariants; save/reload temporarily holds its
  before/after pair. Reports store a digest, compact summary, invariant bodies,
  memory readings, and (when enabled) the compact storage census.

Determinism legs compare checkpoint digests as they arrive from isolated child
processes. A mismatch records the first checkpoint and bounded summaries; the
parent does not deserialize two histories of full snapshots. Save/reload still
performs a full current before/after comparison and emits bounded first-difference
diagnostics on divergence.

The storage census visits `meta`, `teams`, `players`, `rosters`, `games`,
`seasons`, `playerStats`, `transactions`, `draftPicks`, and `news` one cursor row
at a time. Each store reports row count, estimated serialized bytes, average
bytes per row, percentage of total, and delta from the preceding durable
checkpoint. It never uses `getAll()` solely to estimate size.

### 15.2 V1 audit evidence (seed 1684)

The audited main SHA was
`9adacebe3037c1c4c1a63df84d0ae485ea09f6cc` (the merge commit for PR #1778;
PR #1779 was not present on main). Before implementation, the full lifecycle
completed one season at 508 MiB peak RSS and five seasons at 2,410 MiB peak
RSS. The ten-season collect-all run reproduced invariant failures at the
season-7 rollover and exhausted V8's approximately 4 GiB heap during the
season-9 rollover while deserializing a worker message.

The post-instrumentation five-season census distinguishes that process failure
from save payload size:

| Season rollover | post-GC heapUsed | estimated serialized payload | current canonical snapshot |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 214.7 MiB | 34.4 MiB | 0.50 MiB |
| 2 | 636.0 MiB | 78.2 MiB | 0.53 MiB |
| 3 | 1,032.9 MiB | 99.4 MiB | 0.56 MiB |
| 4 | 1,457.0 MiB | 119.4 MiB | 0.58 MiB |
| 5 | 1,907.8 MiB | 139.3 MiB | 0.60 MiB |

At season 5, the largest serialized stores were `games` (72.4 MiB / 1,441
rows), `teams` (28.3 MiB / 32 rows), `players` (27.8 MiB / 2,215 rows), and
`meta` (6.7 MiB / one row). The cumulative serialized size of every canonical
snapshot constructed through that checkpoint was only 8.7 MiB. Thus historical
snapshot retention was real, unbounded diagnostic state and is removed here,
but it was **not** the primary explanation for the approximately 4 GiB Node
failure. The dominant retained heap in this harness tracks fake-indexeddb's
in-heap representation of growing persisted history plus live worker state.
This evidence does not establish browser disk allocation and does not justify
production history deletion; store-level archival fidelity requires a separate
UI-authority and compatibility audit before any compaction.

## 16. Runtime & peak-memory benchmarks

Measured headless (Node 22, `fake-indexeddb`, seed 1684) on the CI-class
container used for this PR:

| Mode | Wall-clock | Peak RSS | Seasons completed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `durability:test` (units + bounded real smoke) | **~18 s** | ~0.3 GB | n/a (init→regular→playoffs) | 29 tests |
| 1-season, `--stop-phase=offseason` (+ save/reload) | **~23.3 s** | **377 MB** | 0 full rollover / 1 competitive (bounded) | 126 pass / 0 fail / 31 skip — see `reports/long-save-1-season-bounded.json` |
| 1-season, full rollover (default) | **did NOT complete in-window** | — | 0 | offseason draft rollover dominates (see below) |
| 5-season, full rollover, 5-min phase budget | **~315 s** then phase-timeout | **508 MB** | 0 | 91 pass / 0 fail / 26 skip through `afterPlayoffs`; timed out in the season-1 rollover — see `reports/long-save-5-season.json` |
| 10-season / 20-season | manual; blocked by same rollover cost | — | — | commands left available |

Per-phase costs (seed 1684, representative): boot ~0.3 s; `SIM_TO_PHASE
playoffs` (full regular season) **~9.4 s**; `SIM_TO_PHASE offseason`
(retirements/re-signings) **~5.0 s**; `SIM_TO_PHASE preseason` — the
draft/FA rollover — is the **dominant, blocking cost**: the `draft` phase runs
at **~7 s per batch iteration** and did not reach `preseason` within a 5-minute
budget (instrumented: still drafting at 12+ minutes). See §22.

> Because a single full-season rollover exceeds any practical CI budget, the
> **committed 1-season report is bounded at the offseason checkpoint** (it still
> exercises init → regular → playoffs → offseason + a full save/reload), and the
> **committed 5-season report is the honest partial artifact** from attempting
> the full rollover with a 5-minute phase budget. Both are regenerated by
> `npm run durability:report`.

### 10- and 20-season modes (manual) — commands & measured result

```
npm run durability:10   # tsx scripts/long-save-durability.mjs 10-season
npm run durability:20   # tsx scripts/long-save-durability.mjs 20-season
```

**Measured result:** not attempted to completion. Both modes reuse the same
lifecycle driver and would each need to complete the season-1 offseason
rollover first, which does not finish within the execution window (see the
performance limitation in §22). They are left available for manual runs on
hardware/time budgets that can absorb the offseason cost, e.g. with a large
`--phase-timeout-ms` and `--collect-all`. **This PR does not claim either mode
passed.**

## 17. CI tier placement (measurement-driven)

- **Required on every PR:** `npm run durability:test` (~12 s). It exercises the
  real production lifecycle through playoffs plus the full invariant framework,
  and is fast + stable.
- **Optional / scheduled:** `durability:smoke` (1 full season). Because the
  offseason rollover costs minutes, the full-season run is **not** a required
  per-PR gate.
- **Manual only:** `durability:5`, `durability:10`, `durability:20`.

Per task scope: the 10- and 20-season modes are **not** added to required PR CI,
and the full-season modes are demoted from required CI purely on measured cost —
not because they currently pass or fail.

## 18. How to add a new invariant

1. Create `tests/durability/invariants/<name>.js` exporting `id` and
   `check(ctx) => Result[]` (use `pass`/`fail`/`skip` from `helpers.js`; classify
   phase with `gamePhase(ctx)`; source any bound from `bounds.js`).
2. Register the module in `invariants/index.js` `INVARIANT_MODULES`.
3. Add a fixture-driven unit test in `longSaveHarness.test.js`.
No orchestrator edits are required.

## 19. How to reproduce a failure

Run the same mode + seed the report records: `npm run durability:smoke -- --seed=<seed>`.
`report.firstFailure` names the season, phase, invariant id and entity. Use
`--collect-all` to see every failure at once, and `--write-report` to capture
the full JSON for a repair PR.

## 20. How to change the seed

`--seed=<n>` on any `durability:*` script (default 1684). The seed is threaded
into `Utils.setSeed` through the real initializer.

## 21. Crash blockers patched

`<!-- CRASH_BLOCKERS -->` None required for V1 — the harness reached its
checkpoints without a production crash on the exercised path. Any future
crash-blocker fix will be listed here with before/after behavior and regression
coverage, per the crash-blocker policy.

## 22. Current findings

Classified per the required taxonomy:

- **performance limitation (top priority)** — the offseason **draft rollover
  does not complete within a practical window**. Instrumented on seed 1684, the
  `draft` phase advances at ~7 s per batch iteration and was still drafting at
  12+ minutes; the committed 5-season run times out in the season-1 rollover
  after a 5-minute phase budget (`reports/long-save-5-season.json`,
  `lifecycleException.classification: "performance-timeout"`). This blocks
  full-season and multi-season completion and is the recommended next repair
  (see §23). **Root-cause note:** the `SIM_TO_PHASE` batch loop re-enters the
  `draft` phase branch across many outer iterations rather than draining the
  draft in one pass — a profiling target, not a state-corruption bug.
- **non-deterministic behavior** — unseeded `Math.random()` in multiple
  production modules (see §2). Prevents byte-for-byte determinism guarantees;
  documented, not rewritten in this PR. The determinism check therefore compares
  a normalized outcome.
- **phase-model uncertainty** — draft/FA/rollover sub-phases are bundled into one
  `SIM_TO_PHASE 'preseason'` batch; finer checkpoints would require driving
  internal worker handlers.
- **test-harness limitation** — free agents are absent from the rostered-only
  `FULL_STATE` view; pool-dependent invariants require a `SAVE_NOW` + DB read and
  skip at view-only checkpoints.

**No invariant failures or save/reload divergences were found on the exercised
path.** Through `afterInit`, `afterRegularSeason`, `afterPlayoffs`, and (bounded)
`afterReload`, the committed runs report **0 invariant failures** and a clean
save/reload (`saveReload.ok = true`). The multi-season signal is currently
gated by the performance limitation above, not by a state-integrity failure.

## 23. Recommended follow-up repair PRs

Ordered:

1. **Offseason performance profiling** — reduce draft/FA headless cost so
   full-season durability modes are CI-viable.
2. **RNG seeding completeness** — thread the seeded RNG through the unseeded
   `Math.random()` modules to enable true reproducibility (behavior-preserving).
3. **Finer offseason checkpoints** — optional harness enhancement to validate
   post-draft and post-FA states separately.
4. Any concrete state-integrity failure surfaced by a durability run gets its own
   repair PR named by `report.recommendedNextRepairPR`.

## 24. Explicit do-not-touch list

This PR and its follow-ups must **not**:

- change gameplay balance, progression, retirement, contract, cap, draft-value/
  talent, or AI decision weights;
- change worker protocol, save schema, or UI behavior;
- add new feature surface;
- introduce a synthetic league generator or a parallel simulation engine;
- re-implement production lifecycle rules inside the harness;
- perform a broad worker or RNG refactor;
- add the 5/10/20-season modes to required PR CI;
- weaken an invariant to hide corruption (only phase-aware, documented skips are
  allowed).
